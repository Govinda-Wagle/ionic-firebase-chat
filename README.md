# ionic-firebase-chat
This is a very simple chat application developed using ionic framework and firebase.
Work in progress......

# Installation
1. Create a Firebase project from https://console.firebase.google.com/ and get the configuration required.
2. Add configuration keys to config object in www/js/app.js

   var config = 
   
   {
      
      apiKey: "",
      
      authDomain: "",
      
      databaseURL: "",
      
      storageBucket: ""
      
    };
    
    
3. Run ionic lab from inside the project directory using command line.
4. You should be able to register and login and see the lists of users and chat with the specific user.


# NOTE
I am still working on this..........
